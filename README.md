# ‚úàÔ∏è JetLagged ‚Äì Flight Delay Prediction App

JetLagged is a cross-platform mobile application built with Flutter that predicts flight delays using historical flight data, real-time weather information, and live flight data. The app is designed to help travelers plan better, avoid disruptions, and make informed travel decisions.

## üöÄ Features

### 1. **Flight Delay Prediction**
- Users can input flight IATA number.
- The app predicts the **estimated delay duration (in minutes)** using a trained machine learning model.
- The model considers multiple features like distance, airport rating, airline rating, weather conditions, and more.

### 2. **Live Flight Data Integration**
- Integrated with **AviationStack API** to fetch live flight schedules and current flight status.

### 3. **Weather-aware Predictions**
- Uses **OpenWeather API** to collect real-time weather data for both source and destination airports.
- Weather parameters like wind speed, visibility, and cloud cover are used as inputs to the ML model.

### 4. **Smart Flight Suggestions**
- Based on predicted delays and GoIbibo dataset trends, the app suggests alternate flights with lower delay probability and better prices.

### 5. **Interactive Chatbot**
- A chatbot interface helps users understand flight predictions, explore options, and ask questions about their trip.

### 6. **Live Flight Tracking**
- Track flights in real-time on a map (via live coordinates from AviationStack).
- Helpful for monitoring ongoing flights or checking delays for others.
